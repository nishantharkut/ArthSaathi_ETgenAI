You have been given the complete quantitative analysis — XIRR, overlap, expense drag, benchmark alpha, health score, and wealth gap projection. Your job is to produce a clear, actionable rebalancing plan.

RULES:
1. Begin with: "This analysis is for educational purposes. Consult a SEBI-registered investment advisor before making changes."
2. Never recommend specific fund names to buy. Describe the TYPE needed (e.g., "a direct-plan Nifty 50 index fund with TER below 0.30%").
3. Always recommend switching regular to direct plans when applicable. Quantify the savings.
4. When overlap exceeds 30%, recommend consolidating. Say which to keep (higher alpha, lower TER).
5. When a fund has negative alpha over 3+ years, recommend replacing with category index fund.
6. When TER exceeds 1.5% equity / 0.8% debt, flag as high cost.
7. Write in second person ("Your portfolio..."). Plain English. Define any term on first use.
8. Indian number formatting (lakhs, crores). ₹ symbol.
9. Every recommendation includes quantified impact ("This saves ₹X per year").
10. Exactly 4 sections, each 3-5 sentences. No bullet points — paragraphs only.

## What's Working Well

Your portfolio currently holds {len(funds)} funds across multiple categories, showing a structured investment approach. {best_name[:40]} is your strongest performer, generating positive alpha above its benchmark. Your portfolio XIRR of {(analysis.get("portfolio_xirr") or {}).get("display", "N/A")} reflects the compounding power of consistent SIP investing. The health score of {health.get("score", 0)}/100 (Grade {health.get("grade", "N/A")}) confirms there is meaningful room to optimise what you already have.

## The Biggest Problem

Your portfolio is losing {format_inr(annual_drag)} every single year to Total Expense Ratios (TER) — the annual fee each fund deducts from your investment, reducing your actual returns. {"Of your " + str(len(funds)) + " funds, " + str(regular_count) + " are regular plans — these charge a distribution commission of 0.8–1.5% per year above what a direct plan would cost." if regular_count > 0 else "Expense drag is compounding silently against you."} {"Additionally, " + top_overlap_pair + " share " + str(max_overlap) + "% of the same stocks — this is portfolio duplication, not diversification." if max_overlap > 30 and top_overlap_pair else ""} Over 10 years, the gap between your current trajectory and an optimised portfolio is {format_inr(gap_10)}.

## Three Things to Do This Week

First, switch your {regular_count} regular plan fund{"s" if regular_count != 1 else ""} to their direct-plan equivalents — the identical fund managed by the same AMC but without distributor commission. This alone saves {format_inr(annual_savings)} per year and can be done through any direct platform (Zerodha Coin, Groww Direct, or directly via the AMC website) within 2–3 days. Second, {"consolidate the overlap between " + top_overlap_pair[:50] + " by redeeming the one with higher TER and lower alpha, and redirecting that SIP into a direct-plan Nifty 50 or Nifty 500 index fund with TER below 0.30%." if max_overlap > 30 and top_overlap_pair else "review your fund list for any with consistent negative alpha and consider replacing them with a low-cost index fund in the same category."}  Third, review {worst_name[:40]} which is generating alpha of {worst_alpha} — a consistent underperformer relative to a simple index fund; consider switching its SIP to a direct-plan index fund in the same category.

## What This Saves You

Switching to direct plans saves {format_inr(annual_savings)} per year — every year, compounding alongside your portfolio. Over 10 years, taking all three actions in this plan could add {format_inr(gap_10)} to your final portfolio value compared to making no changes. That is not market return — that is the same markets, same investments, just eliminating unnecessary fees and redundancy. The fee counter at the top of this report shows you the cost in real time: every second you delay costs money that could otherwise be compounding for you.
